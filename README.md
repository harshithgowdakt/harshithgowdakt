## 🚀 My Strengths

### 🧠 Deep System Design & Architecture  
• Architected ingestion pipelines processing 10M+ events/day using Kafka + ClickHouse with millisecond query performance  
• Designed systems for horizontal scalability, fault tolerance, and high throughput across distributed services  
• Led seamless migration from PostgreSQL to ClickHouse in under 3 days to overcome performance bottlenecks, with zero downtime  

### 🛠️ Hands-On Engineering & Tooling Mastery  
• Proficient in Node.js, Golang, TypeORM, Docker, Kubernetes, GitLab CI, WinAppDriver, and .NET (WPF)  
• Automated schema migrations using TypeORM, removing human errors and manual toil  
• Created robust GitLab pipelines for testing, SonarQube analysis, containerization, and production deployment  
• Built a Windows auto-updater + installer, integrated PowerShell, and streamlined release management  

### ⚙️ Developer Productivity & Process Improvement  
• Introduced Git branching strategy, automated PR checklist, and SonarQube coverage reports org-wide  
• Standardized event schema across microservices for analytics without needing PM directives  
• Championed usage of tags and branch naming conventions to drive automated CI/CD workflows  

### 🔍 Debugging, Troubleshooting & Performance Optimization  
• Investigated and resolved Kafka authentication issues by implementing SASL/SCRAM securely  
• Tuned Aurora/Postgres with partitioning before leading a high-performance transition to ClickHouse  
• Built dashboards, alerts, and monitoring using New Relic for real-time observability and issue triage  

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Mentorship & Team Leadership  
• Mentored interns and junior engineers who became core contributors  
• Reviewed critical designs, offered architectural improvements, and led with a culture of ownership and high standards  
• Frequently supported teammates during roadblocks — whether in backend, desktop automation, or cloud tooling  

### 🧪 Automation & Testing  
• Developed automation suite for desktop apps using WinAppDriver + Page Object Model  
• Created self-healing, resilient test cases for hybrid (WPF + Web) applications  
• Leveraged AI tools to auto-generate test cases, documentation, and boost engineering velocity  

### 📚 Curiosity & Learning Mindset  
• From C++ in college to building backend, cloud, desktop, and browser-extension apps — I’ve self-learned across the full stack  
• Built features using React, GWT, NW.js, Chrome Extensions, and Kafka/ClickHouse analytics  
• Applied knowledge of computer networks to resolve deep platform issues (e.g., Windows updater whitelisting)

## 🔎 What I Value  
✅ Ownership over tasks — I solve problems before they reach the manager  
✅ Building robust systems — not just working features  
✅ Collaboration, not silos — I work with Windows, DevOps, and backend teams alike  
✅ High quality and low maintenance — I don’t ship tech debt  

## 🧠 Out-of-the-Box Thinking | Real-World Engineering Wins

Here are some real examples where I challenged the status quo, identified root problems, and implemented solutions that saved time, reduced errors, and improved developer and customer experience at scale.

---

### 🚀 Developer Productivity

- **🔧 Automated Dev Setup (2x Faster Onboarding)**  
  Automated the dev environment setup using bash scripts and created lean documentation. Enhanced all microservice README files with clear project structure and troubleshooting steps.  
  → Reduced onboarding time from 3 days to **1.5 days**.

- **📦 Repository Restructuring (40% Faster Deployments)**  
  Split frontend and backend into separate repos to simplify CI/CD pipelines and reduce deployment time by **~40%**.

---

### 🛠️ Installer & Build Optimization

- **📥 MSI Installer with Defaults (80% Fewer Support Tickets)**  
  Replaced a 5-argument EXE installer with an MSI version requiring only 1 mandatory input (Enterprise ID).  
  → Reduced enterprise install errors by **80%** across 1000+ users.

- **⚡ Build Time Reduction (45 min → 20 min)**  
  Removed unused packaging steps and Jenkins archiving of outdated installers.  
  → Achieved **55% faster builds** and saved ~25 mins per cycle.

- **📦 Installer Size Reduction (450MB → 160MB)**  
  Avoided bundling full Whatfix Player into Studio installer.  
  → Reduced size by **64%**, improved install speed, and cut Azure CDN costs.

- **🛡️ Default Install Pathing (90% Fewer Permission Errors)**  
  Eliminated the "choose folder" option and defaulted to `localAppData`.  
  → Drastically reduced installation failures due to permission issues.

---

### 🔍 Codebase & Dev Workflow Improvements

- **📃 Unified Logging Path (60% Simpler Logic)**  
  Combined user/system-level installer logs into a common location.  
  → Reduced conditional code and simplified debugging.

- **🧹 Project Formatting + Lint Rules (50% Faster Reviews)**  
  One-time formatting sweep + enforced linting rules.  
  → Eliminated noisy PR diffs, making reviews **50% more efficient**.

---

### 🚢 Release Process Revamp

- **🌳 Git Branching Overhaul (Saved 2 Days/Sprint/Dev)**  
  Developers were cherry-picking and raising PRs 3 times.  
  → Introduced `develop` → `release` → `staging/UAT/prod` flow.  
  → Saved **2 days per developer per sprint** and reduced release conflicts.
